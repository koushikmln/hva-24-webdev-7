            <p>The draft law has proposed far-reaching changes to the present Act, including ensuring the representation of Muslim women and non-Muslims in such bodies.</p>
            <p>NEW DELHI: From renaming the Waqf Act to providing representation for women and a separate Board of Auqaf for Boharas and Aghakhanis, the government has proposed several amendments to the Waqf Act, 1995. Significantly, the proposed bill has
                omitted the contentious section 40 relating to the powers of the Board to decide if a property is Waqf property. The Bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament this week. The Opposition parties said that they would oppose the Bill. To
                ensure the representation of women, the Bill proposes to provide for a broad-based composition of the Central Waqf Council and the State Waqf Boards and ensure the representation of Muslim women and non-Muslims. It will also provide for
                the establishment of a separate Board of Auqaf for Boharas and Aghakhanis.</p>
