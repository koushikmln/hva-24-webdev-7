        <p>DENMARK AND GERMANY AND THE END OF OUR WATERBORNE TOUR OF EUROPE</p>
        <p>It has been at least ten years since we were in Denmark and from the looks of things it certainly has grown up in terms of tourism. We arrived in Copenhagen early in the morning and docked in a brand new port. So new that there was no cruise terminal
            and very little parking for tour buses and vans. It was a nice day, so we boarded a local city bus and headed into town. The city was packed with tourists. At the plaza in the heart of central Copenhagen the huge flea market was like a magnet
            for tourists and locals alike. A striking aspect of Copenhagen are the bike paths. It seems that everyone rides a bike in this city. Winter, summer, rain or snow the numbers of bicycles on the streets would rival the chaotic roads in Ho Chi
            Minh City. We walked Nyhavn harbor which is filled with tall ships, houseboats and restaurants. We decided to take a Hop-on-Hop-off bus since the cost for an all-day pass on these tour buses is a mere 2 Euros. </p>
